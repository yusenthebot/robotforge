## Current state

Rounds 1-3 done, 2026-10-14.

- `sim/session.py`: one MjModel/MjData, real-time advance (only while a viewer is connected), drag with gravity compensation, `load_model` for compiled worlds.
- `sim/render.py`: offscreen PNG snapshots (CGL on macOS, works off the main thread), view presets + model cameras.
- `viewer/`: Starlette + WebSocket thin client (three.js r178 vendored). Grouped per-robot sliders, collapsible panel, Frame button, no-cache headers.
- `design/`: `components.py` (servo/motor catalog with approximate datasheet values, materials, colors), `templates/` (arm 3-6 DOF + gripper, quadruped 12 DOF with IMU/touch/camera, rover diff-drive), `world.py` (pydantic World -> MjSpec, `<robot>/` prefixes, objects incl. table and bin, `home` keyframe), `store.py` (world dir under $ROBOTFORGE_HOME/worlds, atomic edits, undo history, build/world.xml).
- `playground.py` + `mcp_server.py`: 18 MCP tools (design + control + observe + open_viewer with MCP Apps ui:// resource). `robotforge mcp` runs it on stdio; `robotforge open <world dir|mjcf|urdf>` opens the viewer.

## What worked

- MjSpec `attach(child, prefix, frame)` makes multi-robot worlds and imports clean. Each attach needs a fresh child spec.
- Real-parts sizing: quadruped (sts3215) stands unaided, arm holds a ready pose, rover drives straight at 10 rad/s.
- MCP SDK 2.x (`MCPServer`, `mcp.server.apps.Apps`) covers MCP Apps natively.
- Raising `ToolError` for anticipated failures gives agents actionable text ("Did you mean shoulder?").

## What did NOT work (and the fix)

- mcp 2.x hides messages of unexpected exceptions from clients; tools must raise `ToolError` (wrapped via `_tool_errors`).
- `Apps` snapshots its tools at `MCPServer(...)` construction: register `@apps.tool` before creating the server.
- Viewer showed a stale UI after code changes: browsers heuristically cached index/app.js. Now `Cache-Control: no-cache` (ETag revalidation).
- 604 px-wide pane (same as an inline chat app) made the old fixed panel cover half the view; now collapsible and grouped.
- `claude -p` real-agent run: blocked by expired CLI OAuth (needs user). `codex exec`: first run reached the model but MCP calls needed `mcp_servers.<name>.default_tools_approval_mode="approve"`; later runs fail with "workspace routing discovery failed/timed out" though curl to OpenAI works via the proxy. Needs the user. Also: `codex exec` waits on stdin unless `< /dev/null`.

## Round 4-5 additions

- Behaviors: `behaviors/quadruped.py` (trot, per-leg DLS IK; mj_jac needs mj_comPos, not just mj_kinematics), `drive.py`, `arm.py` (arc sweeps within joint limits, safe travel height, reach pre-check), `manager.py`.
- Viewer: WASD driving, robot picker, follow camera; `robotforge open <world>` uses the Playground so driving works without an agent.
- Scripts: `robotforge/script.py` API + `script_runner.py` lockstep runner over a token-guarded localhost socket.
- What did NOT work: straight-line arm carries through the base (IK singular, cube dropped) -> cylindrical arcs; shortest arc crossed the +-180 deg yaw limit -> limit-aware sweep; reach check from home pose stalled for targets behind -> seeded yaw; rover wheels torque-starved (kv too low) -> stiff speed loop; script budget spin when < 1 step left.
- RL decision (user): SB3 as optional extra + UniLab as external backend with ONNX policy playback. UniLab pins torch 2.7 + mujoco-uni 3.8, so it cannot share our venv.

## Next-round seed

Round 5 (now): wave 1 agents are running on feat/humanoid, feat/import-doctor, feat/robot-library, feat/ci, feat/control.
As each reports: review its diff, run the full suite in its worktree, merge into main serially (resolve shared-file conflicts in world.py, manager.py, mcp_server.py, app.js), re-run the suite on main, verify in the browser pane, push.
Wave 2 after that: free-form parts builder ("any robot"), scenes + terrains (heightfield, slopes, stairs, obstacles, preset scenes), RL tier 1 (SB3 extra on RobotEnv), UniLab bridge (export task, train externally, ONNX playback; start with pretrained Go2/G1 policies).

## Frontier

- Current ceiling: design + inspect + manual control of three template robots; no autonomous behavior yet.
- Next frontiers: behaviors (round 4), import doctor + robot library (round 5), real-agent evals once CLIs work, MCP App embed in Claude Desktop (needs user to add the server to Claude Desktop).
- Radical ideas weighed: physics in browser via MuJoCo WASM (kept for sharing only).
- Escalation ladder: open-loop gaits -> CPU RL for custom morphologies -> GPU backends (MuJoCo Warp on NVIDIA) -> sim2real.
